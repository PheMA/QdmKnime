	abstract = {Our objective was to develop a {DNA} biobank linked to phenotypic data derived from an electronic medical record ({EMR}) system. An "opt-out" model was implemented after significant review and revision. The plan included (i) development and maintenance of a de-identified mirror image of the {EMR}, namely, the "synthetic derivative" ({SD}) and (ii) {DNA} extracted from discarded blood samples and linked to the {SD}. Surveys of patients indicated general acceptance of the concept, with only a minority ( approximately 5\%) opposing it. As a result, mechanisms to facilitate opt-out included publicity and revision of a standard "consent to treatment" form. Algorithms for sample handling and procedures for de-identification were developed and validated in order to ensure acceptable error rates ({\textless}0.3 and {\textless}0.1\%, respectively). The rate of sample accrual is 700-900 samples/week. The advantages of this approach are the rate of sample acquisition and the diversity of phenotypes based on {EMRs}.},
