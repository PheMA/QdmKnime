Reviewer Comments (Indvidual reviewer comments are denoted by #1, 2, etc.): 

1: From SPC: The reviewers agree that the paper is important and novel. Issues raised by the reviewers could be addressed to improve the clarity of the writing and help put the work into a larger context, such as the effort that might be required to scale this solution at other institutions.

Authors' Reply: Our thanks to the reviewers for their very helpful comments. Based on these comments, we perceive the core issues to stem from the lack of clarity on the nature of the formal results we have obtained. We address these issues by splitting the "Results and Discussion" section into a separate "Results" section and a separate "Conclusion" section, and by editing text where appropriate to improve clarity. As pointed out By Reviewer (2), part of the issue is that we are describing a prototype and therefore do not yet have an extensive set of formal evaluation results to present. We clarify this issue in the text as well, and add a description in the Discussion section about what we are planning to do to address this in future work.

2: Interesting paper and very well written. It provides a lot of good descriptive background about the origin and purpose of the KNIME platform, as well as how it can be used. Where I got lost was in the Results and Discussion section, since I was assuming that there would be a formal analysis of the tool, but it seems as if that was not done, perhaps because this work is still preliminary. If there are more clear results to report I would strongly suggest separating the Results and Discussion section and clearly describing each. Further, if the "Test Dataset" should be considered methods, I would clearly label that section and perhaps provide more detail about what was actually done. Otherwise this ends up being a descriptive, high level paper about the tool, but it is confusing since it seems like the authors are trying to report findings from its use as well.

Authors' Reply: We have attempted to clarify the results we have now by creating a more cohesive and separate "Results" section, by putting a description of the "Test Data" in the Methods section as you suggest.

3: The approach to transforming multiple sources of heterogeneous clinical information into analyzable datasets appropriate for eCQM calculation is novel and potentially transforming. The application to a specific quality measure, CMS30, is enlightening. The manuscript could be strengthened by estimating the effort it would take to adopt the entire suite of QDM-authored eCQMs in MU Stage 2 on a per institution basis, to help address the question of scale of the proposed solution.

Authors' Reply: We do not have a formal estimate of the amount of work it would take to implement all of the MU eCQMs, but we have added a short description of our current work to create an automatic translator from HQMF to KNIME-based workflows. This in theory will make most eCQMs immediately avaialble as executable worklfows. Institutions would then be required to configure the data access and mapping nodes, but the core logic would be re-usable across many institutions. We will attempt to provide a more detailed analysis of this in the presentation slides, and also hopefully in a future publication.

4: Application of existing workflow tools to complex rule based structures like quality measures and guidelines is very interesting and compelling. The concluding comment about building a community around this type of work is key--it allows us all to spend less time on fundamental infrastructure and more time on the problem at hand. 

The Results section leans towards the discussion, and not as much on results. A table summarizing the complexity of components you needed to write and ease of integration into KNIME could be informative. 

You may wish to consider addressing some of the following should you produce a full length paper in the future: 

* Considerations for the protection of ePHI using tools and frameworks like KNIME. 
* Instrumenting the workflow for monitoring and operation in a production sense (e.g. tracking errors, debugging, etc.) 
* Plans for a GitHub or other source code home for your work (to enable the user community) 
* Data provenance and system provenance (i.e. how do you post process/analyze results from your workflow as components evolve/improve over time).

Authors' Reply: We have re-configured the Results section to focus more purely on results, with discussion left to the concluding section. For lack of space, we do not include the suggested table, but will attempt to do so for the AMIA CRI presentation slides. Thank you for your kind suggestions regarding issues to address in a future full length paper.
